**USEMEMO**
- HOOK USED FOR INCREASING PERFORMANCE, CACHES THE RESULT BASED ON A CALCULATION BETWEEN RE-RENDERS
- USEFUL INCASE OF COSTLY OPERATIONS INVOLVED IN RENDERING PROCESS LIKE TIME INTERVALS, INFINITE PRIME NUMBER CALCULATION, ETC...
- YOU CAN MEMOIZE HEAVY OPERATION.
**USEREF**
- USED WHEN YOU DONT WANT THE VALUE TO BE RE RENDERED, BUT WANT THAT VALUE TO BE TRACKED
**USECALLBACK**
- SIMILAR TO USEMEMO, BUT CACHES THE FUCNTION BETWEEN THE RE RENDERS 

**HOW TO INCREASE THE APP PERFORMANCE::::::** - BY LAZY LOADING, CUSTOM HOOKS ,SHIMMER UI, ETC..

## CHALLENGES:::::::::::::::::::(DATA LAYER) GET DATA LIVE, UPDATE THE UI(UI LAYER)

    - 2 WAYS FOR GETTING NEAR REAL TIME LIVE DATA /DATA IN STREAMING APLLICATIONS

    ** WEB SOCKETS ** 
    - THIS IS A 2 WAY CONNECTION/BI DIRECTIONAL , LIKE A HANDSHAKE B/W UI AND SERVER, WE CAN SEND FROM EITHER SIDES
    - THERE IS NO INTERVAL, DATA CAN COME AT ANY TIME SAY 1MS, 10MS, 10MIN ETC 
    - PASSING DATA IS DONE THROUGH EVENTS
    - AFTER ALL DATA IS OVER, THEN IT SENDS "UPDATED" STATUS 
    - WEB SOCKET CONNECTION IS HEAVY, AS IT CONNECTS AS SOON AS APPLICATION OPENS/STARTS AND GO ON SENDING DATA 2 DIRECTIONS
    - INITIAL CONNECTION TAKES TIME, ONCE CONNECTED WE CAN SEND DATA TO WHERE EVER WE WANT TO SEND, AND IT CAN BE FROM ANY DIRECTIONAL
                            
    ** LONG/API POLLING **
    - THIS IS ONE DIRECTIINAL DATA FLOW FROM SERVER TO UI, IT HAS TIME INTERVAL BETWEEN THE RESPONSES THAT ARE BEING SENT
    - YOU CAN POLL THE SERVER AND GET DATA WHENEVEAR WE WANT(TO CHECK IF MORE DATA IS THERE)

    ## EXAMPLE::: 
    - `GMAIL`(API POLLING :::::: COZ WE NEED NOT TO SEND THE MAIL THE NEXT SEC IT IS SENT BY USER, WE CAN POLL SERVER EVERY 10SEC IF NEW MAIL IS THERE)
    - `STOCK MARKET APPLICATIONS, ALL TIME CRITICAL APPS LIKE CRYPTO APPS,TRADING APPS, STOCKS LIKE ZERODHA, CHAT APPS LIKE WHATSAPP`
    (SINCE ORDER OF MSG, TIME STAMP HAS TO BE MAINTAINED) -- (WEB SOCKETS) SINCE IT NEEDS TO REAL TIME BY EVERY MILLI SEC
    - `CRICBUZZ` USES API POLLING, IT USES 25SEC INTERVAL B/W API CALLS AS IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH CRICKET LOGIC, WITHIN MIN 25SEC THERE WILL NO UPDATE RELATED TO NEXT BALL
                                            
    - `ANALYZING YOUTUBE CHAT`:::: 
    - IT USES API POLLING, EVERY 1.6 SEC OR SO, THATS WHY TIMESTAMP IS NOT THERE AND ORDER MAY NOT BE INTACT
    - THE OPTIMIZED BEST TECH AND USER EXPERIENCE IS PROVIDED/DECIDED BY PRINCIPLE ENGINERR/STAFF ENGINEER/ARCHITECT ETC...OF HIGHER TECH EXPERTISE 
    - ALSO IT HAS 2 THUMBNAILS IN API RESPONSE MSG PREVIEW AS BASED ON SCRN SIZE , THAT PARTICULAY SIZE OF IMG IS USED 
    - BUT WHY PAGE IS NOT FREEZING:::::::::::::::::::::::::
        - COZ YOUTUBE IS DELETING OLDER MSGS AFTER SOME TIME /SIZE OF MSGS OR SOME CRITERIA. ALSO IT CHANGES ITS CRITERIA OF HOW MANY CACHING MSGS SHOULD BE THERE, BASED ON MACHINE/INTERNET SPEED, BROWSER TYPE ETC,ETC... 
        - CONFIHURING DIFF OFFESTS FOR DIFF BROWSERS ETC.. FOR BETTER UX 
        - INSTAGRAM ALSO , IF YOU SCROLL LIKE 500 REELS AND GO BACK, THE ORDER OF REELS IS NOT SAME COZ CACHE IS DELETED
